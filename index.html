  <h1>My Favourite Hobby: Photography</h1>

<p>Photography has always been my passion. Capturing moments and turning them into memories gives me immense joy. I love exploring different types of photography, from landscapes to portraits and street photography. Every picture tells a story, and with the right angle, light, and composition, you can express emotions that words sometimes cannot. Photography has also taught me patience and observation. Whether using a smartphone or a professional camera, the key is to see beauty in everyday life and preserve it forever. Sharing photos with friends makes it even more rewarding, especially when i get compliments from my work. </p>
